# stalker-finder

Project is based on social engineering technique, means trying to manipulate target user to give his/her personal information. When target user installs main.apk and follows instructions then details are received on admin.apk. Here dummy name "main.apk" of app is used because I don't want search engines to index name and flag this as virus. For instructions open admin.apk

### Extra Stuff

  			For any app store you have to tell what that app does, and stalker will know. So I don't have any plan to upload it on any app store
-  Why code is not available on repository?
    		I don't want google to index terms/strings used in app, otherwise stalker will google those and know directly what this app does.
